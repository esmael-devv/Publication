### Abstract (short version)

This work implements a face detection and recognition pipeline using classical computer vision techniques. Faces are detected from images and recognized using an Eigenfaces/PCA-based representation. The system was evaluated on a small custom dataset to demonstrate feasibility for low-cost security and attendance-tracking scenarios.

### Keywords
